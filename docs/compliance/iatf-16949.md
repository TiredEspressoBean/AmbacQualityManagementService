# IATF 16949 Compliance

Automotive quality management system requirements mapping.

## Overview

| Framework | Version | Readiness |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| IATF 16949 | 2016 | **70%** |

IATF 16949 builds on ISO 9001:2015 with automotive-specific requirements, particularly the AIAG Core Tools.

## Core Tools Assessment

| Tool | Status | Evidence | Gap |
|------|--------|----------|-----|
| **APQP** | 🟡 Partial | Process/Step models; approval workflows | Phase gate tracking |
| **PPAP** | 🟡 Partial (50%) | Design records, process flow, SPC, dimensional results | PSW generation, submission tracker |
| **FMEA** | 🟡 Partial | Can store as Documents | RPN calculation, FMEA data model |
| **MSA** | ❌ Missing | - | Gage R&R study records |
| **SPC** | ✅ Implemented | Full implementation | - |

## SPC Implementation

The system provides comprehensive SPC capabilities:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Chart types | X̄-R (subgroups 2-8), X̄-S (subgroups 9+), I-MR (individuals) |
| Capability indices | Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk |
| Control limits | 3σ limits, auto-calculated |
| Baseline management | Freeze/update with audit trail, `superseded_reason` |
| Out-of-control rules | Western Electric rules (8 rules) |
| Specification limits | From MeasurementDefinition (USL, LSL, nominal) |

**Key files**: `Tracker/models/spc.py` (SPCBaseline, SPCDataPoint)

## Control Plan Support

Control plan data is captured via `StepMeasurementRequirement`:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `measurement_definition` | Links to measurement specs |
| `step` | Process step |
| `sequence` | Order of measurements |
| `mandatory` | Required vs optional |
| `tolerance_override_upper/lower` | Step-specific tolerances |
| `special_characteristic` | Critical/significant marking |

**Key files**: `Tracker/models/mes_lite.py` (StepMeasurementRequirement)

## Special Characteristics

The system supports special characteristic marking:

| Level | Field | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Critical | `StepMeasurementRequirement.special_characteristic` | Safety/regulatory |
| Significant | `StepMeasurementRequirement.special_characteristic` | Fit/function |

Special characteristics trigger:
- Mandatory measurement recording
- SPC monitoring requirements
- Enhanced control plan visibility

Per clause 8.7.1.4, rework is controlled:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Visit counting | `Part.rework_attempt_at_step` increments per revisit |
| Maximum visits | `Steps.max_visits` limits rework attempts |
| Rework routing | Disposition workflow routes to rework step |
