# Verification & Closure

The final phases of CAPA: verifying corrective actions worked and formally closing the investigation.

## Verification Phase (D7)

After implementing corrective actions, verify they were effective.

### What to Verify

| Question | Method |
|----------|--------|
| **Was action implemented?** | Review evidence, inspect |
| **Did it fix the problem?** | Check data, no recurrence |
| **Are there side effects?** | Monitor for new issues |
| **Is it sustainable?** | Procedures updated, training complete |

### Verification Activities

Common verification tasks:

1. **Audit**: Check implementation
2. **Data Review**: Compare before/after metrics
3. **Sample Inspection**: Verify parts produced correctly
4. **Process Confirmation**: Walk the process
5. **Document Review**: Procedures updated

### Recording Verification

1. Open the CAPA
2. Go to **Verification** tab
3. For each corrective action:
   - Document verification method
   - Record results
   - Attach evidence
4. Conclude effectiveness

### Verification Outcome

| Outcome | Next Step |
|---------|-----------|
| **Confirmed** | CAPA auto-closes, corrective actions verified effective |
| **Not Confirmed** | Additional RCA review required, new corrective action task created |
| **Inconclusive** | More data needed, continue monitoring |

## Effectiveness Review

Schedule a follow-up effectiveness review:

1. Set review date (e.g., 30/60/90 days post-closure)
2. Monitor for recurrence
3. Review related metrics
4. Document continued effectiveness

### Effectiveness Criteria

Define measurable criteria:

- Zero recurrence for X months
- Defect rate below Y%
- No related customer complaints
- Process capability maintained

## Prevent Recurrence (D7)

Beyond fixing the immediate issue:

### Horizontal Deployment

Apply learnings to similar:

- Processes
- Products
- Suppliers
- Locations

### Systemic Changes

- Update procedures
- Modify training
- Change specifications
- Implement poka-yoke

### Knowledge Capture

Document lessons learned:

- What happened
- Why it happened
- How it was fixed
- How to prevent in future

## Closure Approval

CAPAs require approval to close:

### Submitting for Closure

1. Ensure all tasks complete
2. Verification documented
3. Click **Request Closure**
4. Add closure summary
5. Submit

### Approval Workflow

1. Request goes to approver(s)
2. Approver reviews:
   - Problem resolved
   - Root cause addressed
   - Actions verified effective
   - Documentation complete
3. Approver approves or returns

### Approver Actions

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Approve** | CAPA closes |
| **Reject** | Returns to owner with comments |
| **Request Info** | Needs more detail |

### Approval Signature

Closure requires electronic signature:

1. Enter password to verify identity
2. Signature recorded with timestamp
3. Audit trail created

## Closing the CAPA

On approval:

1. Status changes to **Closed**
2. Closure date recorded
3. Team notified
4. CAPA archived
5. Metrics updated

## Closure Summary

The closure record includes:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Problem Statement** | Original issue |
| **Root Cause** | Verified cause |
| **Corrective Actions** | What was done |
| **Verification** | Proof of effectiveness |
| **Preventive Actions** | Systemic changes |
| **Lessons Learned** | Key takeaways |
| **Approval** | Who approved, when |

## Reopening CAPAs

If the problem recurs:

1. Go to closed CAPA
2. Click **Reopen**
3. Enter reason
4. CAPA returns to Open status
5. Continue investigation

Reopened CAPAs are tracked as:

- Indicator of ineffective closure
- Metric for CAPA quality

## Post-Closure Monitoring

After closure:

1. **Effectiveness Review**: Scheduled check
2. **Metrics Monitoring**: Watch for recurrence
3. **Audit Inclusion**: Include in quality audits

## CAPA Metrics

Closure-related metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **On-time closure** | % closed by due date |
| **Average days to close** | Cycle time |
| **First-time effectiveness** | % not reopened |
| **Verification compliance** | % with proper verification |

## Regulatory Considerations

For regulated industries:

- **FDA**: CAPA is required element of QMS
- **ISO 13485**: Clause 8.5.2/8.5.3
- **AS9100**: Clause 10.2
- **IATF 16949**: Clause 10.2.3

Ensure documentation meets requirements.

## Permissions

| Permission | Allows |
|------------|--------|
| `verify_capa` | Verify CAPA effectiveness |
| `close_capa` | Submit for closure |
| `approve_capa` | Approve closure |
| `change_capa` | Reopen closed CAPAs |

## Best Practices

1. **Don't rush closure** - Verify thoroughly
2. **Evidence-based** - Document everything
3. **Measurable criteria** - Objective effectiveness
4. **Follow up** - Monitor post-closure
5. **Share learnings** - Prevent elsewhere
