# Welcome to Ambac Tracker

Ambac Tracker is a **Quality Management System (QMS)** and **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)** built for modern manufacturing teams. Whether you're tracking parts through production, managing quality inspections, or maintaining compliance documentation, Ambac Tracker provides the tools you need.

## Who Uses Ambac Tracker?

Ambac Tracker serves different roles in your organization:

| Role | What They Do |
|------|--------------|
| **Operators** | Move parts through production steps, record measurements, flag issues |
| **QA Inspectors** | Perform inspections, create quality reports, manage dispositions |
| **QA Managers** | Oversee CAPA, approve documents, review analytics |
| **Administrators** | Configure processes, manage users, set up system |
| **Customers** | View order status, access documents (portal access) |

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, here are the key concepts you'll encounter:

### Orders
An **Order** represents a customer request—typically a purchase order or sales order. Orders contain parts that need to be manufactured or processed.

### Parts
**Parts** are individual items being tracked through production. Each part has a type, belongs to an order, and moves through steps in a process.

### Processes & Steps
A **Process** defines the workflow for manufacturing a part type. It consists of **Steps**—the individual operations like "Machining," "Inspection," or "Assembly."

### Work Orders
A **Work Order** links a process to an order, defining what work needs to be done. It tracks which step each part is currently at.

### Quality Reports (NCRs)
When something goes wrong, a **Quality Report** (also called a Non-Conformance Report or NCR) documents the issue, affected parts, and required disposition.

### CAPA
**Corrective and Preventive Action** (CAPA) is a formal process for addressing quality issues, identifying root causes, and preventing recurrence.

### Documents
**Documents** are controlled files—work instructions, specifications, certificates—with revision tracking and approval workflows.
