## 📋 Corrected Compliance Status

**What's Actually Ready for Military Contracts:**
- ✅ Basic parts traceability and quality control
- ✅ Document management and version control  
- ✅ Standard authentication and basic audit trails
- ✅ Process workflow management

**What Needs Implementation Before Military Contracts:**
- ❌ Multi-factor authentication
- ❌ Data encryption (at rest and in transit beyond HTTPS)
- ❌ Export control tracking and flagging
- ❌ Advanced audit logging and monitoring
- ❌ Granular access controls
- ❌ Automated security scanning and response

**Bottom Line**: Current system provides solid QMS foundation but requires $200K-$500K investment to meet basic military compliance requirements, with full compliance requiring $750K+ investment over 18-24 months.
