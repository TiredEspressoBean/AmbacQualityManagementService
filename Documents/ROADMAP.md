- 🟢 **Yacht:** Request tracing with correlation IDs
- 🟢 **Yacht:** Structured JSON logging
- 🟢 **Yacht:** Penetration testing
- 🟢 **Yacht:** SOC 2 Type II preparation

## Important Note: QMS Software vs. QMS Certification

**This is QMS SOFTWARE for manufacturers to use - not a QMS system being certified.**

- **Your software** provides the tools and workflows manufacturers need
- **Your customers** (manufacturers) use your software to run their QMS
- **Your customers** get ISO 9001/AS9100D certified, not you
- **Success metric:** Can a customer achieve certification using only your software?

**What "Complete QMS" means:**
- ✅ Software has all modules needed for customer certification
- ✅ Generates all required records, audit trails, and reports
- ✅ Enforces required workflows and controls
- ❌ Does NOT mean you (the software vendor) need certification
- ❌ Does NOT mean you need production data or evidence of use

- 🔴 Change management - ECO/ECR workflow (See Section 12: Change Management)

### High Value (Automotive Competitive Features)
- 🔶 **PPAP** - ~50% COVERAGE (4/18 complete, 7 partial, 5 missing). See Section 12 for full breakdown.
  - ✅ Have: Design records, process flow, dimensional results (SPC), Cpk/Ppk
  - 🔶 Partial: FMEA storage, control plan storage, ECN docs, test results, lab docs, checking aids
  - 🔴 Need: PSW generation, submission tracker, MSA/Gage R&R, customer approval, AAR, customer-specific requirements

### Medium Value (Nice to Have)
- Assembly genealogy (BOM tracking) - depends on product complexity
- Advanced reporting (compliance reports, audit packages)
- 🟡 Wire ProcessFlowPage to actual Process/Step data (currently hardcoded demo)

**Status: SPC module complete. PPAP ~50% coverage (4 complete, 7 partial, 5 missing). Supplier and Change Management remain for full automotive support.**

### Enables:
- 🔶 Deploy to Segment B - pending Supplier & Change Management modules
- 🔶 Support IATF 16949 certification foundation - SPC ready, needs supplier/change mgmt
- ✅ Pricing: $70-80K/year (base + automotive modules)
- 🔶 Scale to 5-10 customers - can start with SPC-focused customers
- ❌ Cannot yet support aerospace (needs FAI, material traceability, full PPAP)

## Phase 4: Aerospace Expansion (Segment C - DEFERRED)

**Target Segments:** Segment A + Segment B + Segment C (Add AS9100D)

**Goal:** Enter aerospace market after automotive foundation is proven

### Critical (Must Have - AS9100D Requirements)
- Material lot tracking and C of C generation (See Section 12: Material Lot Traceability)
- First Article Inspection (FAI) - leverage existing 3D annotation system (See Section 12: FAI)
- Full PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) (See Section 12: PPAP)
- Special process controls (See Section 12: Special Process Controls)

### High Value (Aerospace Competitive Features)
- Assembly genealogy and recall simulation
- Counterfeit prevention (See Section 12: Counterfeit Prevention)
- Customer source inspection (See Section 12: Customer Source Inspection)

### Medium Value (Defense-Specific)
- Export control flagging - ITAR/ECCN (See Section 12: Export Control)
- Customer/government property tracking

### Enables:
- ✅ Deploy to Segment C (aerospace primes, tier suppliers, defense)
- ✅ Support AS9100D certification audits
- ✅ Pricing: $90-120K/year (base + automotive + aerospace modules)
- ✅ Full market coverage (general, automotive, aerospace)

## Feature Sponsorship Opportunities

**Certain expensive features can be fast-tracked if customer sponsors development:**

### Sponsorable Features (Phase 3-4)
- **Supplier Management** ($30-35K sponsorship) - Then $12K/year module fee
- **Advanced SPC** ($25-30K sponsorship) - Then $10K/year module fee
- **First Article Inspection** ($30-35K sponsorship) - Then $15K/year module fee
- **Material Traceability + C of C** ($25-30K sponsorship) - Then $12K/year module fee
- **Assembly Genealogy** ($30-40K sponsorship) - Then $12K/year module fee

### How It Works:
1. First customer pays development fee + annual module fee
2. Customer gets feature priority, delivery timeline commitment, design input
3. Future customers pay only annual module fee (no development fee)
4. Sponsoring customer gets 6-12 month competitive advantage

## Strategic Decision Points

### After Phase 1 (Demo-Ready):
**Question:** Do we have 10-15 discovery calls showing interest from Segment A?
- **Yes** → Proceed to Phase 2 (build for ISO 9001)
- **No** → Revisit positioning, target different segment, or improve demos

### After Phase 2 (Segment A Pilots):
**Question:** Do we have 2-3 paying pilot customers (Segment A) using the system?
- **Yes** → Choose: Scale Segment A OR expand to Segment B (automotive)
- **No** → Fix product-market fit issues before expanding scope

### After Phase 3 (Segment B Ready):
**Question:** Do we have 5-10 customers across Segments A and B generating $400-600K ARR?
- **Yes** → Choose: Scale automotive OR expand to aerospace (Segment C)
- **No** → Focus on retention, referrals, and go-to-market before new segments

### **Hardest Implementation Challenges**

1. **Supplier Management** - Broad scope, requires external coordination, performance metrics, incoming inspection workflow
2. **Training Management** - Enforcement complexity, competency verification, step-level restrictions, integration with process workflows
3. **First Article Inspection** - AS9102 forms complexity, multi-stakeholder approval workflow (NOTE: 3D annotation integration is straightforward - reuses existing system)

### **Quickest Compliance Wins**

1. **Export Buttons** - operational improvement
2. **Group Admin UI** - completes RBAC implementation
